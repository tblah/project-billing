# project-billing
This project contains some implementations of secure privacy-friendly billing for smart meters. It is build on top of [proj_net](https://github.com/tblah/project-net).

Documentation automatically generated by cargo doc is available [here](https://tblah.github.io/project-billing/proj_billing/index.html). And there is a demo program in src/main.rs. As an example usage of the test program, see ./test\_scripts and demo.odp.

This project is licenced under GPL version 3 or later as published by the [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org).

**Please do not use this for anything important. The cryptography in proj_crypto has not been reviewed by a professional. And this implementation is far from production ready.**

Building (you may need to install libsodium first):
```
cargo build
```

Testing:

Be warned that he timing on the automated test of the three party protocol is very temperamental on slower machine, probably because my code sucks. If you are having problems please first try the interactive demo to determine if the issue is just in the timing of the test. A quick and dirty solution would be to increase the thread sleeps in billing/mod.rs around the part which is not working.
```
cargo test
```

To generate documentation:
```
cargo doc
```

For documentation of the cryptography see [proj_crypto](https://github.com/tblah/project-crypto).
